                <h4>Our Commitment</h4>
                <p>The Wilmington Iron & Metal Company purchases, processes, and markets a wide array of scrap metals, metal bearing waste streams, and other recyclable materials for industry and the general public. Wilmington's industrial client base includes manufacturers that supply parts to the automotive and aerospace sectors as well as metal working firms involved in the manufacture of goods for the construction, equipment, and retail sectors. The Company operates one of the cleanest and most environmentally compliant scrap facilities in the world. In 2005, Wilmington became the first scrap facility in the U.S. to be certified to ISO 9001 (quality), ISO 14001 (environmental), and OHSAS 18001 (safety).</p>
                <h4>Today</h4>
                <p>Wilmington remains one of very few recycling firms in the U.S. to have earned and kept these international certifications. We take great pride in our people, our facility, and the economic and environmental value of our services.</p>
